      <h2>References and Resources</h2>
      <p>
        The Base Convertor project is a culmination of concepts and techniques derived from a variety of educational and professional resources. These references have been instrumental in shaping the functionality and user interface of the application. The resources cover essential topics such as number systems, algorithm design, and web development. Below is a detailed list of the references that were pivotal in the development of this project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Base Conversion:</strong> 
          <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/base-conversion-method.html">Math is Fun - Base Conversion Method</a>. 
          This resource provided foundational knowledge on number systems, explaining the theoretical underpinnings of base conversion techniques. The clarity of examples and step-by-step breakdown of binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal conversions laid the groundwork for implementing accurate conversion algorithms in JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Base Conversion Guide:</strong> 
          <a href="https://docs.litmus.io/litmusedge/how-to-guides/analytics-guides/base-conversion-function">Litmus Edge - Base Conversion Function</a>. 
          This guide offered advanced insights into the mechanics of base conversion functions. It emphasized efficient algorithm design, which was crucial for optimizing the code to handle large inputs and ensure precise results.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Base Conversion Library:</strong> 
          <a href="https://docs.analytica.com/index.php/Base_Conversion_Function_Library">Analytica - Base Conversion Function Library</a>. 
          This library provided a rich set of tools and examples that inspired modular and reusable code design for the conversion logic. It also introduced techniques for validating user inputs and handling edge cases, enhancing the robustness of the application.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</strong> 
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. 
          As a comprehensive platform for web development, W3Schools was an invaluable resource for understanding and implementing semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and interactive JavaScript. The tutorials guided the creation of an intuitive and accessible user interface while maintaining best practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CSS Styling and Themes:</strong> 
          Dark theme inspiration and tips from 
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">W3Schools CSS Tutorials</a>. 
          These tutorials helped in designing the dark-themed interface of the Base Convertor, emphasizing user experience and readability. The lessons on CSS properties such as `backdrop-filter`, `box-shadow`, and responsive design techniques ensured the application looks visually appealing on all devices.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each of these references provided a unique perspective, whether it was understanding theoretical principles or implementing practical solutions. Together, they ensured that the Base Convertor was not only functionally accurate but also user-friendly and efficient.
